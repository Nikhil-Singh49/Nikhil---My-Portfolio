# Nikhil---My-Portfolio
Web Dev Unit-1 assignment
The webpage is a personal online portfolio for someone learning web development.

It starts with their name and a simple menu to navigate through the site easily.

A welcome message introduces the person and the purpose of the website.

The "About Me" section shows their photo and shares their passion for web development.

"My Projects" lists different things they've created, including a portfolio page, a blog like Medium, a birthday card, and a contact form.

There's a special birthday card section with a warm message to add personality.

The blog section features two example posts with titles and dates to show their writing or updates.

Their technical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are displayed in a straightforward table.

At the bottom, a contact form allows visitors to send messages directly.

The whole site uses very basic HTML, great for someone just starting to build websites.

Its purpose is to introduce the person, showcase their work, and provide an easy way to communicate.
